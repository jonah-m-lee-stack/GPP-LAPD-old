data.py and 3D_S_Coherence.py are scripts for post-processsing and analysis of the simulation data. 3D_S_Retry.py is the main simulation script. The original scripts were written by HarryGX0331 on GitHub.
I made a few modifications to the main() function as I was running into an Out of Memory Error. Original scripts can be found at https://github.com/HarryGX0331/GPP-LAPD.
